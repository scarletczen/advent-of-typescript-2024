[Things are staring to heat up in the North Pole. The reindeer have been blackmailing Mrs. Claus in order to get fair pay, threatening to expose her affair with 🪩Jamie Glitterglum.]

[🎅Santa] GET ME THOSE NAMES!!!!!!!!!!

[🎩Bernard] I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it!

[🎅Santa] TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!

[🎅Santa throws a giant box of delicate glass Christmas tree ornaments against the factory wall, sending shards of glass flying in every direction]

[🎩Bernard] Ah, there's the classic 🎅Santa we all know and love. Smashing priceless ornaments while screaming unintelligibly. Truly, the Christmas spirit personified.

[🎅Santa] TODAY! I NEED THEM TODAY!! ACTUALLY I NEED THEM LAST MONTH!!!

[🎩Bernard] You want every name? Fine. I'll even get you the ones with seven middle initials and the kids named after TikTok trends.

🎩Bernard has a very long list of names from the Social Security Administration, but we need to format the data into objects so 🎅Santa can ingest it into his existing system.

Help 🎩Bernard before 🎅Santa continues his violent tirade.

A HUGE hint
Part of the fun/trick of this challenge is that you can't solve it normally by iterating because you'll get:
Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.ts(2589)
Type produces a tuple type that is too large to represent.ts(2799)
For example, many people will probably first try:

```
export type Solution<
  Row extends [string, string, string][],
  Accumulator extends { name: string, count: number}[] = []
> =
  Row extends [
    [infer Name extends string, string, infer Count],
    ...infer Rest extends Row,
  ]
  ? Solution<
      Rest,
      [
        ...Accumulator,
        {
          name: Name,
          count: Count extends `${infer CountNum extends number}` ? CountNum : never
        }
      ]
    >
  : Accumulator;
```

or the non tail-call recursive version:

```
export type Solution<
  Row extends [string, string, string][],
> =
```
