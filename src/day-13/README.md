[❤️Cupid] WHEN I"M DONE WITH HIM THERE WON"T BE NOTHIN" LEFT!!!

[💨Dasher] Bro, I want the same things you do but you gotta take a chill pill.

[❤️Cupid] I"M READY TO EXPLODE ON HIS CHIMNEY-CLIMBIN" ASS.

[💃Dancer] Look, ❤️Cupid. Here's the thing. We are close. We have 💋Crystal Right where we want her. We can use her to get what we want. And, after all, we'll be doing her a favor because she's also getting what she wants - to keep things about her and 🪩Jamie quiet.

[❤️Cupid] OUR TERMS BETTER BE BULLETPROOF BECAUSE THAT COOKIE-STEALING MANIAC IS GONNA FIND A WAY TO WEASLE OUT OF IT.

[💃Dancer] Yes. Absolutely. Let's make sure no term can conflict with any other. Think of it like designing a GraphQL Schema - no room for innovation.

The reindeer are almost ready to make their demands. Help the reindeer make terms for their demands in such a way that no term can be conflated with any other term.

Hint
Are you familiar with the terms covariant, contravariant, bivariant, invariant? If so, might be useful to read up on those!
