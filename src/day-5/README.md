[❤️Cupid and 🌟Vixen are presenting 🎅Santa with their work on the route for this year's Christmas present delivery.]

[🎅Santa] What is it? Are you guys working blindfolded or what!??

[❤️Cupid] Hardly. We've been working on this for weeks and weeks.

[🎅Santa] What am I even shelling out these beautiful carrots for? It's like it's suddenly amateur hour at the North Pole!

[🌟Vixen] Actually, funny you should raise that point because you pay us for a quality of work far below what we've just provided. You should be thrilled.

[🎅Santa] I don't want any more of that attitude from you, 🌟Vixen. I think you should think of the position that puts your colleagues in when you talk like that. Should I pay them less just so I can pay you more? Huh?

[🌟Vixen] I'm getting tired of going around-and-around with you on this. Just tell us what you want.

[🎅Santa] Well for one thing, the route should be should be able to handle any arbitrary input! And while you’re at it, make the route solar-powered. The PR team says it’s time we went carbon neutral.

🎅Santa is hard to please. That much is for sure. To appease him, we want a function that will accept any input and return a value that has exactly the same type.
