[🪩Jamie] You're lying. You didn't see anything because nothing was happening. I haven't done anything wrong!

[🌟Vixen] I literally saw you and 💋Crystal with my own two eyes. Would you like me to describe the unicorn tattoo on your left cheek? Nice one, by the way.

[🪩Jamie, sweating] Damn it. You did see. What are you going to do?

[🌟Vixen] 🪩Jamie Glitterglum. It's not what I am going to do to you but rather what you are going to do for me.

[🪩Jamie] Huh?

[🌟Vixen] We've been arguing with Santa about our pay. You seem like someone uniquely positioned to help get him to change his mind.

[🪩Jamie] You absolute jerk! You're blackmailing me!

[🌟Vixen] Look, we all have our own goals. Get 💋Crystal to convince him to pay us what we're worth. We literally haven't had a pay raise since 2009. This shouldn't be so hard, but you know 🎅Santa. He could care less about the rest of us.

[🪩Jamie] Well how am I supposed to do that?

[🌟Vixen] There's an npm I've been working on, santas-special-list. Honestly it’s a mess of untyped spaghetti code and patched dependencies, so good luck with that. Let's start there. It needs types. I was supposed to do it, but I need some cover so I can discuss all this with the other reindeer. You make the types for me so I can slip away for a few hours. I'll find you tomorrow and let you know what you need to do next.

[🪩Jamie] I hate you. I have always hated you. Now I hate you more.

[🌟Vixen] After what you're about to do for me, I think we're going to be great friends. 🖤

🪩Jamie sure is in trouble. Help 🪩Jamie do 🌟Vixen's job by making types for the santas-special-list package. Things are really heating up in the North Pole!
