[🎅Santa] Sadly, she's no longer a 10.

[🎩Bernard] Are we talking about the same thing??

[🎅Santa] Huh? Oh. Right, you were talking about the reindeer.

[🎩Bernard] Yeah, what were you talking about?

[🎅Santa] Nothing, nothing. So just tell them they'll get their raise when they can show some dedication to this business.

[🎩Bernard] The thing is they feel like they've more than accomplished that over the last 15 years since they last got a pay increase.

[🎅Santa] Tell them we'll review it during the next performance review.

[🎩Bernard, facepalming] And when is that?

[🎅Santa] When their performance improves! You think I just give raises to anyone who pulls a sleigh? This isn’t charity.

We need a type for a function that represents the performance review cycle. With this function in hand, perhaps 🎩Bernard will be able to convince 🎅Santa to take the reindeer's demands more seriously.
