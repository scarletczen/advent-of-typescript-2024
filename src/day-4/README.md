[🎩Bernard (the head elf) presenting data to 🎅Santa showing how much harder it is for the Reindeer to make a living with their wages not changing since 2009 at the same time as housing prices rising dramatically AND high inflation over that period.]

[🎅Santa] FAKE DATA!! THIS IS FAKE DATA!!!!! A FAKE DATA WITCH HUNT!!!

[🎩Bernard] Oh, sure, 🎅Santa, I spent all night cooking the books just to screw over a guy who still thinks Excel is a type of sleigh polish.

[🎅Santa] I've been around the block a few times, 🎩Bernard. I know the trick you're pulling here. We're a seasonal business. You only gave me numbers for Q1 of every year. But that's when our economy is always depressed after the height of the holiday season!

[🎩Bernard] I can't believe they let you run this place... 🎅Santa.. 🎅SANTA!!... We maintain a huge budgetary deficit that literally only ever seems to get larger and larger. These numbers are not affected by the seasonality of our business.

[🎅Santa] I want to be able to give quarterly numbers. And since 1975.

[🎩Bernard] This is the last time I'm doing this for you. You're going to need to face the music.. and pretty soon!

When 🎅Santa uses this function, sometimes he'll want to pass a number, like survivalRatio(2009) and if he wants a specific quarter he'll pass survivalRatio('2009 Q2'). Our function needs to be able to handle both of these data types, not just numbers.
