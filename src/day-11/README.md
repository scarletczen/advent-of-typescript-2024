[Last night, while the reindeer plotted on how to leverage 💋Crystal Claus with their knowledge of her affair with 🪩Jamie Glitterglum, 💋Crystal and 🪩Jamie met up in a panic. Today, 🎅Santa is beginning to suspect something]

[🎅Santa] Dear.. Where were you last night?

[💋Crystal, turning bright red in embarrassment] Oh. Uh, I was out doing karaoke with some friends. Kendrick Lamar and Opeth both released albums on the same day last month, so we've been learning all the songs to both. [coughing nervously] Oh [cough] and also we were trying out a new drink one of the elves came up with. It's a bit like a mojito but instead of mint it's.. well it's a whole thing. Then we also

[🎅Santa] You seem nervous.

[💋Crystal, sweating] Oh, no, not at all! Not at all! It's just so hard to remember, you can understand!

[Later that night 💋Crystal and 🪩Jamie met again.]

[💋Crystal] We're in BIG trouble. What are we gonna do!!? We need a new excuse, and we need to add something to it. But... what??

[🪩Jamie] Talk to him again, but this time be ready to add to your excuse! Just bury him in details. 🎅Santa tunes out if you say anything longer than two sentences about non-cookie-related topics. Think of a few different excuses, just in case.

We already have a Excuse that 💋Crystal provided 🎅Santa, but now we need to extend it in some way. We need it to be general-purpose, so 💋Crystal can try a few different ideas out.
